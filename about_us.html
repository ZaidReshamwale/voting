                <span class="style28">&nbsp;INTRODUCTION TO <span class="style37">ONLINE VOTING SYSTEM</span>                “ONLINE VOTING SYSTEM”</span> 
<blockquote>
  <p class="style29">It is an online voting technique. In this system people who have citizenship of INDIA and whose age is above 18 years and any sex can cast the vote online without going to any physical polling station. There is a database which is maintained in which all the names of voters with complete information are stored.
    In “<strong>ONLINE VOTING SYSTEM</strong>” a voter can use his\her voting right online without any difficulty. He\She has to be registered first for him/her to vote. Registration is mainly done by the system administrator for security reasons. The system Administrator registers the voters on a special site of the system visited by him only by simply filling a registration form to register voter. Citizens seeking registration are expected to contact the system administrator to submit their details. After the validity of them being citizens of India has been confirmed by the system administrator by comparing their details submitted with those in existing databases such as those as the Registrar of Persons, the citizen is then registered as a voter. 
    After registration,  the  voter  is  assigned  a  secret  Voter  ID with  which  he/she  can  use to  log  into  the  system  and  enjoy  services provided  by  the  system  such  as  voting.  If invalid/wrong details are submitted, then the citizen is not registered to vote. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style28"><u>Objectives  Of The <span class="style37">Online Voting System</span></u>.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="style29"><strong>The  specific objectives of the project include:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Reviewing  the existing/current voting process or approach in INDIA;</li>
      <li>Coming  up with an automated  voting system in  INDIA;</li>
      <li>Implementing   an automated/online voting system;</li>
    </ol>
    <p><span class="style29">Validating the system  to ensure that only legible voters are allowed to vote.  </span></p>
  </blockquote>
<p class="style32">The main purposes of <span class="style33">Online Voting</span> include:</p>
  <ol>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="style35 style29">Provision of  improved voting services to the voters through fast, timely and convenient  voting. </span></li>
    <li class="style35">Reduction of the costs incurred by the INDIAN  Electoral Commission during voting time in paying the very many clerks employed  for the sake of the success of the manual system.</li>
    <li class="style35">Check to ensure that the members who are registered  are the only ones to vote. Cases of “Dead People” voting are also minimized.</li>
    <li class="style35">Online voting system (OVS) will require being very  precise or cost cutting to produce an effective election management   system.</li>

    <li class="style35">Require less  number of staff during the election.</li>
    <li class="style35">This system is a  lot easier to independently moderate the elections and subsequently reinforce  its transparency and fairness.</li>
    <li class="style35">Less capital,  less effort, and less labor intensive, as the primary cost and effort will  focus primarily on creating, managing, and running a secure online portal.</li>
    <li><span class="style35 style29 style38">Increased number  of voters as individual will find it easier and more convenient to vote,  especially those abroad.</span>    </li>
