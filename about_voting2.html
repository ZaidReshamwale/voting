                <blockquote>
                  <p class="style24">You should note that mere possession of an  EPIC issued to you does not guarantee you your vote, because it is mandatory  that your name should appear in the electoral roll.  Once you have found out that your name is there  in the electoral roll and you also possess an identification document  prescribed by the Election Commission (EPIC or others), you are entitled to  vote.   </p>
                  <span class="style24">Before you come to the polling booth, there  are some other important aspects that you need to know as an elector and a  conscientious citizen of the country.</span></blockquote>
                <p class="style22">8. What is the Disclosure by  Candidates?</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p class="style24">Recently the Election Commission of India  has made it mandatory consequent upon a Judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court that  all candidates must file an affidavit along with their nomination form with  details such as:- <br>
                  i.  his/her criminal antecedents,  <br>
                  ii. his/her assets and liabilities and  those of his/her spouse and dependents, and<br>
                  iii.  his/her educational background.  This has  been done with a view that every citizen has a right to know about the  candidates contesting an election and make an informed choice.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p class="style24">The Election Commission has directed all Returning Officers to display the  copies of nomination papers and accompanying affidavits received during any day  on his notice board immediately on receipt and make copies of these for  distribution to the press and any members of public who want this information,  free of cost. Any citizen of the country can obtain copies of the nomination  form and the affidavit filed by any candidate from the Returning Officer and it  shall not be refused. As a voter you have every right to seek this information  and get it.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p class="style24">The details of the dues owed by the candidates to the Government are published  by giving an advertisement in the leading newspapers by the Returning Officer  for the benefit of electors.Above  measures help the electors make an informed choice about the candidate they are  going to vote for.                  </p>
                  <p align="left" class="style19">&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
                <p class="style22">9.  What are the basic do’s and don’t’s as  polling day approaches?</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p class="style19">As a voter you should also know the aspects  that are considered as corrupt practices or electoral offences: <br>
                    <strong>(i)</strong> Offering or accepting money or any  other gratification either to vote for or not to vote for a particular candidate.<br>
                    <strong>(ii)</strong> Inducement by way of liquor, feast,  gifts, etc. to vote for or not to vote for a particular candidate. <br>
                    <strong>(iii)</strong> Inducement to vote or not to vote for  a particular candidate on the grounds of religion, caste, community, sectarian  beliefs or place of birth.<br>
                    <strong>(iv)</strong>  Threat to an elector of ex-communication if he votes for or against a  particular candidate.  </p>
                  <span class="style19"><strong>(v)</strong> Offer of free conveyance to any elector to  go to or from any polling station</span>.

  </blockquote>
                <p align="left" class="style22"><strong>10.  What  is the process of voting? How do you go about it?</strong></p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p class="style24">The poll date and hours are fixed by the  Election Commission India and they are well publicized before all elections. <br>
                    </p>
                  <p class="style24">  When you reach the polling station, entry will be regulated by queues. There  will be separate queues for men and women voters and the physically handicapped  persons. The persons who enforce the queues will allow 3-4 voters into the  polling station at a time. Physically handicapped voters and women voters with  babies in arm will be given precedence over the other voters in the queue. <br>
                    </p>
                  <p class="style24">  <strong>Stage 1:</strong> When you enter the polling station, you will go to the First Polling  Officer who is in-charge of the marked copy of the electoral roll and  responsible for identification of electors. You should keep your identity  document ready to show to the First Polling Officer. You can also show to him  the unofficial identity slip giving your particulars. However, you should note  that unofficial identity slip only helps in locating your name in the electoral  roll but is not a guarantee of your identification. The First Polling Officer  will then call out your name and serial number so that the polling agents  become aware of your presence and your identity is not challenged.  <br>
                    </p>
                  <p class="style24"><strong>Stage 2:</strong> Thereafter, if your identity is not challenged, you will proceed  to the Second Polling Officer who will mark your left forefinger with the  indelible ink. Thereafter, he will proceed to record your serial number in the  electoral roll in the Register of Voters.   Once this is recorded, you are to sign in the appropriate column in the  Register of Voters. If a voter cannot sign, his/her thumb impression will be  obtained. The Second Polling Officer will then give you a signed voter’s slip  which will record your serial number in the register of voters and your serial  number in the electoral roll.<br>
                    </p>
                  <p class="style24"><strong>Stage 3:</strong> You will then proceed to the Third Polling Officer who will  take the voter’s slip issued to you by the Second Polling Officer. The Third  Polling Officer will press the &quot;Ballot&quot; button on the Control Unit of  voting machine and direct you to the voting compartment where you will record  your vote on the balloting unit of the voting machine. Please note that each  voter will proceed to the voting compartment in exactly the same sequence in  which his/her serial number is recorded in the voters’ register.<br>
                    </p>
                  <p class="style24"><strong>Stage 4:</strong> Voting Procedure.<br>
                    •  Inside the voting compartment, you are to press the blue candidate button on  the Balloting Unit against the name and symbol of the candidate of your choice. <br>
                    • Press the button only once.<br>
                    • On  the candidate button being pressed, the red lamp will glow against the name and  symbol of that candidate.<br>
                    •  There will also be a beep sound heard to indicate that your vote has been  recorded and the Busy lamp goes off in the Control Unit.<br>
                    •  This process is repeated for other voters till end of the poll.  <br>
                    </p>
                  <p class="style24"> You must remember that secrecy of  voting is important. Every elector is expected to maintain the secrecy of  voting and in case of failure to maintain secrecy the elector may not be  permitted to vote. Any person who violates the secrecy, will be booked for an  offence under Section 128 of Representation of People Act, 1951. You should,  therefore, not disclose to any person who you have voted for. Similarly, if any  election official attempts to obtain information on who you have voted for, it  will amount to an offence committed by that official. Photography of a voter  casting vote is prohibited. It may also be noted that no polling official or  agent can come inside the voting compartment under<span class="style24"> the pretext of helping you to vote.  You can, however, be permitted to take a  companion of not less than 18 years with you for recording your vote, if  for any physical infirmity you require such  assistance.                  </span>                  </p>

                <p align="left" class="style22"><strong>11. Can you decline to cast your vote at the  last stage?</strong></p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p align="center" class="style24">The  law enables a voter to decline casting his vote at the last stage. If you  decide not to cast your vote after having signed on the Register of Voters and  after having received the voters’ slip from the Second Polling Officer, you  must inform the Presiding Officer immediately. He will then take back the  voters’ slip from you and proceed to record in the remarks column of the  Register of Voters that you have declined to exercise your franchise and you  will be required to put your signature under such entry. After this is done,  you can leave the polling station without proceeding to the Voting Compartment.</p>
  </blockquote>
                <p class="style22"><strong>12. What happens when your vote is challenged?</strong></p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p align="left" class="style24">In  case your identity as a voter is challenged by a polling agent of any  candidate, on the ground that you are not the person whose name is listed on  the rolls, the Presiding Officer will ask the challenger to give evidence in  proof, of his challenge. Similarly, he will ask you for proof of your identity.  You can use your EPIC or any other supporting document like Passport, Ration  card etc. for this purpose. If the challenge is not established, you will be  allowed to vote. However, if challenge is established, you will be debarred  from voting and handed over to the police with a written complaint by the  Presiding Officer.</p>
  </blockquote>
                <p align="left" class="style25"><strong>13.  What  happens if someone else has cast the vote in your name?</strong></p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p class="style24"> If  the First Polling Officer tells you on arrival inside the polling station that  your vote has already been cast, bring this to the attention of the Presiding  Officer immediately. The law allows you to cast a Tendered Vote. A Tendered  Ballot Paper, as per Rule 49P of the Conduct of Elections Rules, will be given  to you and you will be required to sign your name on the list of tendered  votes. A tendered ballot paper is the same as the ballot paper displayed on the  balloting unit, except that it shall be endorsed on the back, with the words,  “Tendered Ballot Paper” either stamped by the Returning or written by the  Presiding Officer at the time of issuing it.  <br>
                  </p>
                  <p class="style24">After marking your choice of candidate  with the help of Arrow Cross Mark rubber stamp you should hand over the  tendered ballot paper to the Presiding Officer, who will keep it in a separate  cover. Please note that in such case, you will not cast your vote on the EVM.</p>
